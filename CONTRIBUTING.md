# Contributing to Soroban DevKit (`sdkt`)

Thanks for considering a contribution! This document covers how to get set up,
how we review changes, and how releases are produced.

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start (with Makefile)

A `Makefile` provides common developer targets:

```bash
make build          # build all crates
make test           # run all tests
make ci             # fmt-check + clippy + test (local CI)
make check          # same as 'ci' — shorter alias for quick verification
make audit-example  # build the example plugin rule (.so)
make plugin-pack    # pack example-rule-1.0.0.sdktplugin
make plugin-verify  # verify the bundle
make compat         # run compatibility CI matrix locally
```

### Manual Workflow

1. **Fork and clone** the repository.
2. **Install Rust** (stable toolchain, edition 2021):
   ```bash
   rustup toolchain install stable
   rustup default stable
   ```
3. **Install the WASM target** (required to build Soroban contracts):
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```
4. **Build** to verify your environment:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your change (e.g. `feat/foo` or `fix/bar`).
5. **Write tests** for any new functionality or bug fix.
6. **Format & lint** before committing:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   ```
7. **Test**:
   ```bash
   # Run the full workspace suite
   cargo test --workspace

   # Or test a single crate (faster for iteration)
   cargo test -p sdkt-cli
   ```
8. **Open a pull request** against `main` from your branch.

   Pull requests are automatically reviewed by CodeRabbit before maintainer
   review. Address its actionable findings, then push incremental changes —
   CodeRabbit re-reviews each push. CI and the maintainer review remain the
   final gates.

   To skip a review on a specific PR, include `@coderabbitai ignore` in the
   pull request description.

### Plugin Bundle Workflow

To pack and verify a plugin bundle locally:

```bash
# Build the example plugin
cargo build -p sdkt-audit-example-rule --features plugins

# Pack
sdkt plugin pack crates/sdkt-audit-example-rule --output myrule.sdktplugin

# Verify (unsigned — fine for local dev)
sdkt plugin verify-bundle myrule.sdktplugin

# Sign with Ed25519 secret key (32 raw bytes)
sdkt plugin pack <plugin-dir> --output myrule.signed.sdktplugin --secret-key key.bin

# Verify signed bundle
sdkt plugin verify-bundle myrule.signed.sdktplugin --public-key pubkey.bin

# Install into local store
sdkt plugin install <artifact.so> --id my-rule

# Audit with --rules <id>
sdkt audit src/lib.rs --rules my-rule
```
## Supply Chain, MSRV & Dependencies

`sdkt` relies on `Cargo.lock` being checked into source control at the workspace root to ensure strictly reproducible builds. 

- **MSRV Policy:** The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) must not be increased without strict dependency or security justification. If a bump is completely unavoidable, contributors must:
  - Document the required update in `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md`.
  - Bump `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`.
  - Update the `msrv` job configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - Explain precisely why the bump was necessary in the pull request description.
- **Adding Dependencies:** When adding a new library to `Cargo.toml`, ensure that the dependency is genuinely necessary (check if standard library solutions exist first). Use optional dependencies and features extensively to prevent artifact bloat.
- **Pinning & Updating:** Our `Cargo.lock` is pinned manually and updated holistically during specific maintenance phases. Do not run `cargo update` indiscriminately in PRs unrelated to dependency updates.

## Testing Instructions

- Unit tests live next to the code (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`).
- CLI integration tests use `assert_cmd` under `crates/sdkt-cli/tests/`.
  Fixture paths are resolved from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, so they work regardless
  of the current directory.
- Run the full suite:
  ```bash
  cargo test --workspace
  ```
- Before claiming a CLI change is done, run the **actual binary** against a
  real fixture in both formats:
  ```bash
  cargo run -q --bin sdkt -- diff --old-wasm a.wasm --new-wasm b.wasm --format pretty
  cargo run -q --bin sdkt -- diff --old-wasm a.wasm --new-wasm b.wasm --format json
  ```

## Pull Request Process

- Keep PRs focused on a single change.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under the relevant version (or `[Unreleased]`).
- Add tests that verify your change.
- If adding dependencies, update the workspace root `Cargo.toml`
  (`[workspace.package]` / member crates inherit versions).
- Ensure public API signatures are clear and documented (`///` doc comments).
- Verify CI checks pass (fmt / clippy / test / docs) before requesting review.

## Code Style

- Use `rustfmt` (`cargo fmt --all`).
- Clippy must pass with `-D warnings`.
- Keep unit tests near the code they test.
- Add doc tests (`///`) for public library functions.

## Types of Contributions

- Bug reports with reproduction steps.
- Feature requests with motivating examples / use cases.
- Pull requests triaged through review.
- Documentation and onboarding improvements.
- Test coverage improvements.

## Platform Support

`sdkt` is tested on CI (`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`):

- **Linux** (x86_64; aarch64 via CI/source)
- **macOS** (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** (x86_64)

GitHub Release **v2.5.0** ships linux-x86_64 and both macOS tarballs.
Windows is installable via `cargo install sdkt-cli` (or source). A Windows
Release zip is produced by `release.yml` on the next `v*` tag, not on v2.5.0.

## Good First Issues

Looking for a place to start? Self-contained, low-risk tasks:

- **Docs**: add a copy-paste recipe to `docs/examples.md`, or improve a section
  in `README.md` / `docs/`.
- **CLI polish**: improve `--help` text or error messages in
  `crates/sdkt-cli/src/main.rs` (no behavior change).
- **Tests**: add an integration test under `crates/sdkt-cli/tests/` for an
  existing subcommand.
- **Plugin bundle tests**: add a round-trip test in
  `crates/sdkt-cli/tests/plugin_bundle_cli_test.rs` (e.g. signed bundle
  with `--force` overwrite, or `plugin update` after pack).
- **Windows**: verify a command or documentation path works on Windows (PowerShell).
- **CI**: tighten a workflow without changing release behavior.

Use the **Good First Issue** issue template and label so we can triage.

## Release Process Overview

Releases are cut from `main` on a `v*` tag. The pipeline (see
`.github/workflows/release.yml`):

1. **`validate`** — runs `fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, `test`.
2. **`publish-dry-run`** — `cargo publish --dry-run --workspace` (packages all
   crates locally; does not contact crates.io for unpublished siblings).
3. **`build-binaries`** — cross-compiles release binaries (linux / macos
   intel+arm) and uploads them as artifacts.
4. **`github-release`** — creates the GitHub Release from the tag.
5. **`publish-crates`** — publishes crates in dependency order
   (`sdkt-core → sdkt-xdr → sdkt-wasm → sdkt-rpc → sdkt-storage → sdkt-audit →
   sdkt-audit-example-rule → sdkt-cli`) when `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is set.

Versioning follows SemVer from `[workspace.package]` as the single source of
truth. Contributors do **not** bump versions or tag releases — maintainers do
that as part of the release milestone.
