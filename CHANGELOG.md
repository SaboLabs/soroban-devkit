### Added
- **Transaction Inspection**: `sdkt tx inspect` command to view transaction hash, status, ledger inclusion, and operation counts.
- **Event Explorer**: `sdkt events` command to fetch and list emitted Soroban contract events.
- **Account Inspection**: `sdkt account` command for base level diagnostics of Stellar/Soroban accounts.
- **Generic RPC request abstraction**: `SorobanRpcClient` now exposes a public `request()` method for generic JSON-RPC interactions.
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite coverage added for `tx`, `events`, and `account` commands using `assert_cmd`.

### Improved
