# Soroban DevKit

**Soroban DevKit** (`sdkt`) is a release-assurance and operational
verification toolkit for [Stellar / Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org)
smart contracts. It consolidates the checks that answer "is this build safe
to release?" — contract inspection, static security auditing, upgrade-safety
diffing, deployed-contract verification, and contract health — into one
command-line interface with an aggregated release decision
(`sdkt release-assurance`), and covers the surrounding workflow (XDR
decoding, storage analysis, transaction lifecycle management, multi-contract
deployment orchestration) so developers stop juggling 5+ separate tools.

The workspace is a Rust workspace published as `sdkt-cli` (binary name:
`sdkt`). Most commands run fully offline; only on-chain operations require
an RPC endpoint.

## What can you do with sdkt?

| Area | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Release assurance** | One read-only command aggregates artifact checks, static audit, upgrade safety, deployed verification, and contract health into a single `PASS`/`REVIEW`/`FAIL` decision (`release-assurance`) |
| **Project workflow** | Scaffold new Soroban projects (`init`), compile contracts to WASM (`build`), inspect WASM artifacts offline (`wasm inspect`) |
| **ABI / ContractSpec** | Decode base64 XDR (`decode`), inspect contract ABI and storage (`inspect`), diff two WASM files for upgrade safety (`diff`) |
| **Security** | Static analysis of contract source with built-in rules (`audit`), plus a plugin system for custom rules |
| **Transactions** | Build, validate, simulate, sign (offline ED25519), and submit transactions (`tx *`); one-command state-changing invoke (`invoke`) |
| **Deployment** | Upload WASM + instantiate contracts (`deploy`) with optional `--deny-breaking` upgrade guard; multi-contract workspace orchestration (`project deploy`) |
| **Contract interaction** | Read-only calls (`call`) and state-changing invocations (`invoke`) with typed arguments and ABI-aware result decoding |
| **Events & storage** | Event explorer (`events`), storage TTL analysis and extension (`storage *`) |
| **Network** | Named network profiles for RPC endpoints + passphrases (`network *`); read-only network identity / protocol / resource-limit diagnosis (`network diagnose`) |
| **Deployment verification** | Read-only check that a deployed contract matches a local WASM artifact (`deployment-verify`) |
| **Plugins** | Local, offline-first plugin store with `.sdktplugin` bundle support (`plugin *`) |
| **Identity** | ED25519 keystore management and Testnet Friendbot funding (`identity *`) |

## Who is this for?

Soroban DevKit is for developers building on **Stellar / Soroban** who want
a single, scriptable, offline-first toolchain for the full contract
lifecycle — from scaffolding and local analysis through auditing,
deployment, and on-chain interaction. It is especially useful for teams
that want reproducible CI gating (audit + upgrade safety) and multi-contract
workspace orchestration.
