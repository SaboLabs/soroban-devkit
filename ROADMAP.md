# Soroban DevKit (`sdkt`) — Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-10-06
**Status:** Active development · default branch `main` · current release **v2.7.0**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

`sdkt` is a unified, offline-capable CLI and Rust toolkit for Stellar / Soroban development — it consolidates the fragmented contract lifecycle (decode, inspect, analyze, build, simulate, submit, audit, deploy) into one binary.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Current release** | `v2.7.0` (tags `v2.0.0`, `v2.1.0`, `v2.1.1`, `v2.2.0`, `v2.3.0`, `v2.4.0`, `v2.5.0`, `v2.6.0`, `v2.7.0` also published) |
| **Repository status** | Active · all capabilities merged to `main` |
| **Crates** | 9 workspace crates — 8 published to crates.io, `sdkt-agent` repo-only prototype — plus the `sdkt-playground` WASM surface (excluded from the workspace) |
| **Current focus** | Release assurance — artifact, security, upgrade, deployed reality, health |

A new contributor can understand the project from this summary alone: a test-covered Soroban toolchain with a clear path toward mainnet readiness and an extensible plugin architecture.

---

## 2. Vision

`sdkt` unifies the Soroban developer lifecycle — inspect, decode, analyze, build, simulate, and submit — into one modular, offline-capable Rust toolkit, instead of juggling 5+ separate CLIs.

---

## 3. Current Architecture

The workspace is a Cargo virtual workspace. The `sdkt` binary is produced by `sdkt-cli`; all logic lives in focused, dependency-bounded crates.

| Crate | Purpose | Key Responsibilities |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| `sdkt-core` | Global configuration & shared types | `DevKitConfig`, `NetworkConfig`, `OutputFormat`, `ValidationError`. No I/O, no networking. |
| `sdkt-xdr` | XDR decode / encode & payload manipulation | `decode()`, `encode_ledger_key()`, `extract_wasm_hash()`, `decode_event_topics()`, typed builder helpers. No networking, no I/O. |
| `sdkt-wasm` | Contract WASM inspection & offline analysis | `ContractSpec` parser, `WasmModule` inspector, `SpecDiff`, `UpgradeVerdict`. Offline only. |
| `sdkt-rpc` | Soroban RPC client & on-chain aggregation | `SorobanRpcClient` (persistent pooled `reqwest`), `TtlInfo`, `ContractInspection`; `simulate` / `submission` / `builder` modules. **The only network-I/O crate.** |
| `sdkt-storage` | Storage analysis, WASM caching, keystore | `StorageAnalyzer`, `StorageReport`, `WasmCache`, `IdentityStore` (ED25519, `~/.sdkt/identities`). |
| `sdkt-audit` | Offline static security analysis | `Severity`, `Finding`, `AuditReport`, `AuditRule`, `RuleRegistry`, `register_rule!`; built-in rules `AUTH-001`, `AUTH-002`, `AUTH-003`, `AUTH-004`, `MOVE-001`, `MATH-001`, `CEI-001`; plugin author API. |
| `sdkt-audit-example-rule` | Reference plugin crate | Rule `EXAMPLE-001`; produces `libsdkt_audit_example_rule` (native) and `sdkt_audit_example_rule.wasm` behind the `plugins` / `wasm-plugins` features. |
| `sdkt-cli` | User-facing CLI | `Cli`, `Commands`; routes arguments to crates and formats output (pretty + `--format json`). Builds the `sdkt` binary. |
| `sdkt-agent` | Read-only natural-language front end (prototype, repo-only — not published) | Deterministic rule-based planner over `sdkt_core::registry`; refuses mutating/mainnet/ambiguous requests; versioned JSON results. |
| `sdkt-playground` | Browser WASM surface (excluded from the workspace, not published) | `sdkt-wasm` inspector exposed to the browser via `wasm-bindgen`; offline inspection plus the upgrade-safety comparison added in v2.7.0. |

**Dependency rules**

- `sdkt-core` depends on no other workspace crate and performs no networking.
- `sdkt-xdr` and `sdkt-wasm` are offline / networking-free.
- `sdkt-rpc` is the sole network boundary (besides `sdkt-storage`'s keystore disk writes).
- Everything may depend on `sdkt-core`; `sdkt-cli` orchestrates the rest.

## 4. Development Progress

Capabilities are grouped by theme below.

### Foundation

- Storage & Inspect — `sdkt storage check`, `sdkt inspect`, RPC client, canonical `OutputFormat` (shipped in early alpha releases)
- Network introspection — `sdkt tx inspect`, `sdkt events`, `sdkt account`, generic RPC (alpha)
- Production hardening — RPC retry/timeout, clippy strict, CI, docs/rustdoc coverage (alpha)

### Developer Experience

- Horizon account enrichment + ScVal pretty UI — Account graph via Horizon REST; human-readable ScVal output (alpha)

### Storage & Inspection

- ABI-aware decoding — `--abi <WASM>` on `events`/`inspect`/`storage check`; real event payload decoding (alpha)
- StorageAnalyzer — `sdkt storage analyze` CLI with full classification (alpha)
- Offline contract inspection — `sdkt wasm inspect <file.wasm>` reads metadata, custom sections, exports, specs
- Contract verification — `sdkt verify` confirms a deployed contract's on-chain WASM hash matches a local artifact
- Contract health report — `sdkt health` aggregates WASM hash + storage/TTL posture into a `healthy`/`at_risk`/`critical` verdict

### Security & Analysis

- ABI/WASM diff — `sdkt diff --old-wasm --new-wasm` offline comparison (alpha)
- Static security analysis — `sdkt-audit` crate with rules `AUTH-001`, `AUTH-002`, `AUTH-003`, `AUTH-004`, `MOVE-001`, `MATH-001`, `CEI-001`; exposed via `sdkt audit <path>`
- Upgrade safety guard — `UpgradeVerdict`; `sdkt diff --upgrade-safety`; `sdkt deploy --deny-breaking`
- Release assurance — `sdkt release-assurance` aggregates artifact metadata, static security audit, upgrade safety, deployed WASM verification, and contract health into one `PASS`/`REVIEW`/`FAIL`/`SKIPPED`/`ERROR` verdict with a machine-readable JSON report
- WASM size policy — opt-in `--max-size-bytes` / `--max-growth-pct` on `sdkt diff` and `sdkt release-assurance`; thresholds are operator-supplied and no network limit is hardcoded
- Deployment verification — `sdkt deployment-verify` compares a local WASM's SHA-256 against the deployed contract's on-chain executable (`MATCH`/`DRIFT`/`UNKNOWN`/`NOT_FOUND`, exit-gated)
- Network diagnostics — `sdkt network diagnose` reports network identity, protocol agreement, and observed ledger resource limits before a release verification trusts a target
- Agent (prototype) — `sdkt-agent` maps plain-English requests onto the capability registry and runs them read-only; repo-only, not published

### Plugin System

- Rule registry — `RuleRegistry` in `sdkt-audit`; additive `--rules <path>`; plugin author API; example rule crate
- Dynamic rule loading — Native `.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll` plugins via `libloading` + C-ABI; `sdkt audit --rules <plugin.so>`; ABI major-version gate (feature `plugins`, default OFF)
- WASM sandbox — Sandboxed `.wasm` plugins via `extism` + JSON-ABI; `sdkt audit --rules <plugin.wasm>`; no FS/network (feature `wasm-plugins`, default OFF)
- **Plugin local store** — Offline plugin store with `plugin.toml` metadata; `sdkt plugin list/show/install/remove/update` (local-only); identity-based `--rules <id>` resolution; shipped in `v2.5.0`
- **Plugin bundle packaging & signing** — `sdkt plugin pack` produces a `.sdktplugin` bundle (manifest + artifact + `manifest.sha256`) and can sign it with an Ed25519 secret key (`--secret-key <file>`); `sdkt plugin install <bundle>.sdktplugin` verifies digests and the signature when present, and `--public-key <file>` pins the expected signer; `sdkt plugin verify-bundle` and `sdkt plugin doctor` check bundle integrity. Shipped in `v2.6.0` (#213).

### Soroban Ecosystem Integration

- On-chain contract inspection — `sdkt wasm metadata --contract <id>` returns complete WASM metadata, parsed ABI, storage summary, and TTL
- Contract metadata decoding — `sdkt wasm inspect` decodes the `contractmetav0` custom section into `key = value` provenance entries (pretty and additive `metadata.contract_meta` JSON)
- On-chain upgrade-safety verification — `sdkt verify --contract <id> --wasm <candidate.wasm> --upgrade-safety` fetches the live contract's spec and classifies breaking vs non-breaking changes
- Live-contract ABI for events — `sdkt events --abi-contract <id>` uses the deployed contract's on-chain WASM to decode events without a local artifact
- Live-contract ABI for storage — `sdkt storage --abi-contract <id>` uses the deployed contract's on-chain WASM for storage analysis
- Protocol 28 support — `sdkt init` scaffolds and `sdkt build` compiles for Protocol 28 targets
- CAP-85 external executables — `sdkt inspect` resolves protocol-defined (`stellar_asset`) and `ExternalRef` executables that carry no WASM artifact
- Verification mismatch exit gate — `sdkt verify` returns non-zero on a mismatched deployed WASM, so CI gates reading the exit code cannot pass a wrong artifact

### CI & Release

- GitHub composite Action — `.github/actions/sdkt/action.yml` wraps `sdkt audit`, `sdkt diff --upgrade-safety`, and `sdkt release-assurance` (including the WASM size policy) for CI
- Release engineering — Unified workspace version; `release.yml`; install-script validation; panic audit on user paths
- Stability — MSRV gate, CI hardening, Windows compatibility, dependency compaction

### Workspace & Build

- WASM tooling & caching — `sdkt wasm metadata`, `sdkt wasm cache`, `sdkt-wasm` crate, `ContractSpec` parser, `sdkt deploy` + `sdkt init` scaffolding
- Workspace orchestration — `sdkt build` compiles artifacts; `sdkt project deploy` handles topological dependency sorting via `.sdkt.toml`

### Package Manager & Distribution

- Local package manifest — `.sdkt.toml` `[package]` + `[dependencies]` (local `path`); `sdkt package validate` offline
- Git dependency sources — `git` deps with `tag`/`branch`/`rev`; `sdkt package fetch` into `.sdkt-cache`
- Lock & reproducibility — `sdkt.lock` records resolved commit/integrity; `sdkt lock verify` covers deps
- Package update — `sdkt package update` with `--check`/`--dry-run`/`--format`; closes the validate → fetch → update → verify loop
- Version resolution — Semver constraints on deps; `VersionResolver` picks best satisfying tag/commit
- Packaging — `sdkt package pack` produces an offline bundle of manifest + lock + cache; `sdkt package publish --dry-run` readiness check
- Release polish — `Dockerfile` distribution, mainnet-safety guards, opt-in `--version` provenance

### RPC & Simulation

- Mutability foundation — `sdkt tx simulate`, `sdkt tx submit`, `sdkt identity` (ED25519 keystore), `sdkt tx build` envelope builder, fee estimation
- RPC pooling — Persistent pooled `reqwest::Client`; configurable timeout / pool settings
- Simulation detail — `sdkt tx simulate` surfaces `restorePreamble` and granular `stateChanges`
- Native transaction signing — `sdkt tx sign` signs envelopes with a local ED25519 identity (offline); `sdkt-xdr` signing library; keystore integration
- Network profiles — Stored RPC profiles with `sdkt network add/list/show/remove` CLI; `--network-profile <NAME>` plus override flags on every RPC command
- Profile integration — Precedence: explicit flags > profile > `.sdkt.toml` > built-in testnet default

## 6. Next Priorities

The package-manager, plugin-ecosystem, and on-chain inspection lines are fully shipped in `v2.5.0`. The remaining backlog items below are explicitly unscheduled:

### Future Work (unscheduled backlog)

- **Plugin ecosystem / marketplace — remote slice.** The local offline-first store, `.sdktplugin` bundle packaging, and Ed25519 bundle signing/verification are shipped (v2.6.0, #213). The remaining remote/marketplace layer — a hosted index/server, remote `https` plugin sources, and remote `sdkt plugin update` — stays unscheduled backlog.
- **Broader Soroban ecosystem integration.** On-chain inspection is shipped. Deeper compatibility-matrix work (beyond the on-chain inspection path) remains unscheduled.
- **Developer productivity** — continuing DX investments (faster feedback, better errors, smoother onboarding).
- **Hosted package registry** — a remote index/server that the `DependencyFetcher` trait can target; explicitly deferred.

## 8. Development Principles

1. **Read-only before mutating** — read-only features ship first, mutating features follow.
2. **Mandatory quality gates** — `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo test --workspace` are required for every PR.
3. **Branch discipline** — default branch is `main`; PRs target `main` from feature branches.
