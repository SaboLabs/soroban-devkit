//! Agent-facing capability registry for the `sdkt` CLI.
//!
//! This is metadata **about commands that already exist** — it executes
//! nothing and adds no new CLI surface. It exists so an agent or orchestrator
//! can discover what the toolkit can do, what each call requires, and how
//! dangerous it is, without scraping `--help` output.
//!
//! Shape of the world it describes:
//!
//! ```text
//! Agent → Tool Registry → SDKT CLI → deterministic evidence
//! ```
//!
//! The registry is the contract layer; the CLI remains the source of truth
//! for behavior. If the two ever disagree, the CLI wins and this table is the
//! bug.
//!
//! # Evidence discipline
//!
//! Every entry carries an [`Evidence`] level. Entries are only marked
//! `Verified*` when the command was actually executed and its exit code and
//! stdout shape were observed (local artifacts, or live read-only calls
//! against Testnet). Anything not observed is `Unverified` and MUST carry a
//! `notes` string saying why — the registry never asserts a capability it has
//! not seen work, and never guesses a mutating command's outcome.
//!
//! # Adding a capability
//!
//! 1. Confirm the command exists: `sdkt <cmd> --help`, and run it once in the
//!    cheapest safe mode (offline fixture, or read-only against Testnet).
//! 2. Append a `Capability` to [`capabilities()`] using struct-update syntax
//!    from [`Capability::BASE`] so only the fields that differ are spelled out:
//!    ```text
//!    Capability {
//!        id: "family.action",          // lowercase, dotted, unique
//!        command: &["family", "action"],
//!        summary: "one line, what it returns",
//!        required_args: &["<arg>"],
//!        formats: PRETTY_JSON,
//!        network: NetworkRequirement::Both,
//!        evidence: Evidence::VerifiedLocal,   // or VerifiedTestnet
//!        ..Capability::BASE
//!    }
//!    ```
//! 3. Rules that the tests enforce — do not work around them:
//!    - IDs are unique and non-empty; `command`, `summary` are non-empty.
//!    - `safety: Mutating` ⇒ `requires_confirmation: true`.
//!    - Read-only commands must NOT set `requires_confirmation`.
//!    - `formats.json: true` only when the real command accepts
//!      `--format json` and emits a parseable document.
//!    - `evidence: Unverified` ⇒ `notes` must explain what is missing.
//!    - Exit codes are the CLI-wide convention: 0 success, 1 runtime/
//!      verdict failure, 2 usage error. Set `verdict_can_fail` only for
//!      commands that exit 1 while still producing a valid report.
//! 4. Add the id to the pinned lists in the tests that cross-check against
//!    observed behavior (`json_format_flags_match_cli`,
//!    `verdict_gated_commands_are_marked`).
//! 5. `cargo test -p sdkt-core` must stay green. Bump
//!    [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] only on a breaking change to this metadata format.
